# Immersive AR-Based Mobile Shopping App

## 👋 Introduction
This project is a **cross-platform mobile shopping application** developed using **Flutter** and **Firebase**, focusing on enhancing the e-commerce experience through **3D product visualization** and **Augmented Reality (AR)**.

The application allows users to interact with **rotatable and zoomable 3D models** and preview products in real-world environments using AR, helping users make more confident purchase decisions and reducing product return rates.

---

## 🧠 Project Motivation
Traditional e-commerce platforms often provide limited product visualization, which can reduce user confidence and increase return rates.

This project aims to:
- Improve product visualization accuracy
- Increase user engagement and trust
- Bridge the gap between physical and online shopping experiences

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Enhance product visualization using detailed 3D models
- Integrate AR for real-world product placement
- Improve purchase confidence and user satisfaction
- Support flexible delivery scheduling during checkout
- Provide a secure and real-time shopping experience

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Programming Language**: Dart
- **Backend & Authentication**: Firebase
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore
- **AR Technology**: ARCore (Android)
- **3D Assets**: Cloud-based model storage
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## ✨ Features
- Interactive 3D product models (rotate, zoom, inspect)
- Augmented Reality (AR) product placement
- Secure user authentication
- Flexible delivery date and time scheduling
- Voucher and discount integration
- Real-time messaging functionality
- Product search and filtering
- Responsive and user-friendly UI

---

## 📊 Results & Evaluation
User evaluation was conducted using structured questionnaires focusing on usability, AR performance, and delivery scheduling.

### Key Findings:
- **91.7%** of users were aged between **18–24**, matching the target audience
- Product search and filtering: ⭐ **4.08 / 5**
- Usefulness of AR feature: ⭐ **3.92 / 5**
- Purchase confidence improvement: ⭐ **4.00 / 5**

Users reported increased confidence in product size and placement decisions when using AR.  
Minor issues such as occasional 3D/AR loading delays were identified and documented for future improvement.

---

## 🧪 Development Approach
The application was developed using an **Agile Prototyping Model**, allowing:
- Early feature implementation
- Iterative UI/UX improvements
- Continuous feedback-driven refinement

Firebase was used to handle authentication, real-time data operations, and secure cloud storage for 3D assets.

---

## 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Optimizing 3D model loading performance
- Handling AR compatibility across devices
- Managing real-time data updates efficiently
- Ensuring UI responsiveness while rendering 3D/AR content

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- iOS support using **ARKit**
- AI-based product recommendation system
- Multilingual support
- Vendor and admin dashboards
- Collaboration with professional 3D asset providers
- Performance optimization for AR rendering
